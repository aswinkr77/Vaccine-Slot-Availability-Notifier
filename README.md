## How to Use the App

- To receive Telegram message, you first need to authorize with CallMeBot_txtbot bot, only then you will receive messaages. To authorize with the bot <b>[go here](https://t.me/CallMeBot_txtbot)</b>. This bot is not owned by me and for more information about the bot, <b>[visit here](https://www.callmebot.com/)</b>
- After successfull authorization with the bot you can start using the website, either from [here](https://aswinkr77.github.io/Vaccine-Slot-Availability-Notifier/) or locally by downloading it. Just clone or download the package. For mobile users running locally will gonna be a headache, so for you a mobile optimised html file is there called mobile_index.html, use it.
